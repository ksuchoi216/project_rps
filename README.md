# ROCK PARER SCISSORS

## 1. understanding the problem
Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.

## 2. plan
### Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
	- Start button + picture 3 for rock paper scissors.
### What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
	- click
### What’s the desired output?
	- win/lose/same + total score
### Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
    loop for five games
    output about total score


## 3. pseudo code
when a user clicks a picture(rock...), randomly pick one out of three for computer selection
then, the result is displayed on the screen as follows:
when the user win the game, "You Win!, Sth beats Sth"
when the user win the game, "You Lose!, Sth beats Sth"
when the user draw the game, "You draw"
This kind of the game is repeated 5 times
then total score is calculated to display winner or losser.

## 4. divide and conquer
- input section
- function for 1 game
- loop for 5 games
- print out total score.
